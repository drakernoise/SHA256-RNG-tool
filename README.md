# SHA256-RNG

An easy to use deterministic random number generator built in python that uses the SHA 256 cryptographic hash function as a means to get a sequence of pseudorandom bits. While being based on a cryptographic hash function, it is not guaranteed to be secure as a random number generator. That being said, it performs reasonably well on the DIEHARD test suite.
